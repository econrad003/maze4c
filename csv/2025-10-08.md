# Comparison of statistics dated 2025-10-07 and 2025-10-08

Both runs consisted of producing 100 perfect mazes for each of 23 different maze carving algorithms.  The mazes were all configured with 21 rows and 34 columns in a Von Neumann grid (*OblongGrid(21,34)*).  The same Python was used to produce the CSVs from which this data was extracted.

For each of the statistics, please take special note of the ranks for Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms as both produce minimum weight spanning trees.  Note that 'Prim/Vertex' and 'Prim/Simplified' designate algorithms which are only superficially related to Prim's algorithm.

Also, please note the ranks of Aldous/Broder and Wilson's algorithm asthese algorithms (ideally) produce uniform spanning trees, that is,every possible spanning tree is (ideally) carved with equal probability.  (I say "ideally" because the implementation uses a pseudorandom sequence, so the implementations are not truly random.)

When comparing the data for 2025-10-07 and 2025-10-08 take note of the standard deviation that follows the plus-or-minus symbol.  *Assuming* the data is normally distributed, there is about a 2/3 chance that it lies within one standard deviation of the mean and about a 19/20 chance that it lies within two standard deviations.  Of course not all data is normally distributed, but Chebyshev's Inequality (*q.v.*) does set some bounds for other distributions.  The distributions here probably exhibit quite a bit of *skewness* and perhaps some *kurtosis* as well.  (Check the Wikipedia entries for these two statistical concepts.)  I have not calculated any measures of skewness or kurtosis, so speculations on such in these notes should be taken with a grain of salt -- or treat them as exercises.

To save horizontal space, names of some of the algorithms were abbreviated in the summaries below.  (One algorithm name was misspelled in the script that produced the CSVs.)  The means and standard deviations were displayed to the nearest thousandth.  Here they are rounded to the nearest tenth to save space.  They could reasonably be rounded to the nearest integer.

The averages (arithmetic means) in both runs were well within one standard deviation.  Some algorithms did change in rank -- for example, Aldous/Broder and Wilson's algorithms exchanged places.

The minimum weight spanning tree algorithms (Kruskal and Prim) ranked 2 and 3, respectively, in both runs. Their means were very slightly higher in the second run.

Aldous/Broder and Wilson occupied 9 and 8 in the first run and 8 and 9 in the second run, with means in the second run slightly less than the first.

None of the differences appear to be noteworthy, but I haven't done a serious analysis of variation (ANOVA).

A degree 2 cell is one with two incident passages, as pictured by cell X in the tiny mazes below:
```
    +---+---+---+         +---+---+
    |     X     |         |     X |
    +---+---+---+         +---+   +
                              |   |
                              +---+
```
In the second maze above, cell X could be described as corner in a crooked corridor, while in the first, it is simply part of a straight run.  The first configuration might be called an I-junction.  In both pictures, cell X has two exits and two walls.

There do not appear to be any noteworthy changes in the means.

Prim and Kruskal rank just above the bottom.  The bottom is ocuppied by vertex-Prim, but note that vertex-Prim averages about 160 degree-2 cells while Kruskal and Prim average around 309 or 310 degree-2 cells - almost double the number for vertex-Prim.

Aldous/Broder and Wilson occupy consecutive ranks (15 or 16) in both runs.

BFS occupies the top spot, with DFS ranking 2.  One standard deviation below the BFS average is barely below one standard deviation above the DFS average.  So the difference is certainly significant.

The two DFF algorithms run just behind DFS with a close third and fourth.  Hunt and Kill is in fifth place.

For each of these top five algorithms (BFS, DFS, DFF/2, DFF/3 and H&K) more than 75% of the cells form corners and I-jubnctions.  On average (as evidenced by Aldous/Broder and Wilson), about 45% of the cells of a 21×34 perfect rectangular maze should be I-junctions or corners.  Vertex/Prim trails with about 22% of the cells.

A degree 3 cell is one with three incident passages, as pictured by cell X in the tiny maze below:
```
    +---+---+---+
    |     X     |
    +---+   +---+ 
        |   |
        +---+
```
It looks sort of like a capital T, so cell X might be called a T-junction.

Notice that there was quite a bit of shuffling of ranks in fourth through fifteenth place.  But also note that the average number of T-junctions in that range was about 156 to 160.

Aldous/Broder and Wilson both averaged about 158 in both runs, so 158 T-junctions is probably a reasonable guesstimate of the average number of T-junctions in a random perfect maze on a 21×34 rectangular grid.  That's about 22% of the cells in the grid.

The means for Kruskal and Prim ranged from 159 to 161 T-junctions.

The top three and the bottom four did not change in rank.

That shifting of ranks about the middle might suggest that the underlying distribution has a high peak and very tiny tails.  (Note to self: investigate kurtosis.  Does this distribution have high positive kurtosis?)

In both samples, about 10.5% of the cells in mazes carved by vertex-Prim were four-way intersections (or plus-junctions, because they look like + signs).

For the minimum weight spanning tree algorithms (Kruskal and Prim) in second and third place, the average falls to about 3.7%.

For the uniform spanning tree algorithms (Aldous/Broder and Wilson) at about 24 cells, we fall to about 3.4%.

At the very bottom is any binary tree algorithm with n0 plus-junctions as every cell in a binary tree has degree 1, 2 or 3.  So the simple binary tree algorithm (the only binary tree algorithm that we sampled) came in dead last.

The next five from the bottom (DFS, DFF/2, DFF/3, H&K, BFS) all had an average from 1 to 4 cells.  Since the average for DFS in the second sample was about 1 and the variance was almost 1, DFS must have produced a binary tree in several runs.  Apparently the same is true for DFF/2.

Note that the standard deviations for many of the algorithms are fairly large.  DFS produced the "widest" mazes with diameters of around 375 passages. But the standard deviations indicate that about 1/3 of the mazes in the sampling had either diameters greater than about 415 passages or less than roughly 335 passages.

At the bottom of the list is inwinder, with about 2/3 of the diameters ranging from about 60 passages to 67 passages.

BFS is next from the bottom with about 2/3 of the diameters ranging from about 65 to about 80 cells.

Results for the uniform spanning tree algorithms (Aldous/Broder and Wilson) indicate that a perfect maze on a 21×34 grid has a diameter of about 130 to 135 passages in length.

(A diameter is a longest path.  Its length is measured in passages or steps.  The number of cells in a diameter is one more than its length.)

### Exercise

Prove (by constructing an example) that the maximum diameter of a 21×34 rectangular maze is 713 passages.

* There are actually two parts.  The first is to construct a 21×34 maze with a diameter of 713 passages.  The second is to show that a diameter on a 21×34 maze cannot have more than 713 passages,

# Notes statistics dated 2025-10-09

The runs consisted of producing 100 perfect mazes for each of 14 different maze carving algorithm and 3 fractal tesselation algorithms.  The mazes were all configured on a 16×16 Von Neumann grid (*OblongGrid(16,16)*).

For fractal tessellation, four passes were made starting with a 1×1 trivial maze with each pass doubling the number of rows and columns.  The three algorithms involved simple placement (the trivial or identity group), placement after a random rotation (the rotation group), or placement after a random rotation or reflection (the dihedral group).  The main purpose here is to compare fractal tessellation with other algorithms

Using the implementation of Wilson's algorithm as the baseline, fractal tessellation seems to produce a slightly below average number of dead ends.

But note the large standard deviations.  If we take the typical range as one standard deviation in either direction (covering roughly 2/3 of the mazes produced), the typical range for fractal tessellation is roughly 55 to 90 dead ends.

Again with Wilson's algorithm as a baseline, the mean number of degree-2 cells in a 16×16 fractal maze is slightly above typical.

Again note the very high standard deviations.  The typical range (one standard deviation either way) is about 90 to 150 degree 2 cells.

Yet again with Wilson's algorithm as a baseline, the mean number of degree-3 cells in a 16×16 fractal maze is slightly below typical.

Note the high standard deviations.  The typical range (one standard deviation either way) is about 38 to 62 degree 3 cells.

With Wilson's algorithm as the baseline, the mean number of degree-4 cells in a 16×16 fractal maze is slightly below typical.

The standard deviations are on the high side -- about three to four times that of the other algorithms.  A perfect maze cannot have very many degree-4 cells as the number of passages in a perfect maze is one less than the number of cells.  (Clearly the number of degree-4 cells must be less than one fourth of the total number of cells.)  The typical range (one standard deviation either way) is about 0 to 15 degree-4 cells.

Note that the distributions for fractal tessellation must be skewed: in all three cases, the standard deviation exceeds the mean, and the number of degree-4 cells can never be less than zero.

Diameters for fractal tessellation are on average, based again on Wilson, a few passages more than the typical diameter.  As with the degree statistics, there is considerable variation, but not as much when compared on a relative basis.  Note that, for DFS, the standard deviation is about 10% of the mean, as compared to roughly 20% for the three fractal tessellation algorithms.  Both Wilson and Hunt&Kill come close with ratios of about 17%.

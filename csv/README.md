# *CSV* (comma-separated variable) file folder

This folder contains spreadsheets produced by the spreadsheet maker modules in the stats folder.

In addition, it may contain *PDF* (portable document format) and *MD* (markdown) reports based on the results in a *CSV*.  *PDF* files will generally be printable versions of the *CSV* while *MD* files will generally include my own interpretations of the results.

The files are organized by experiment -- the filenames start with the experiment date in YYYY-MM-DD (year/month/day) format.

The *stats* folder contains the Python module (also dated) used to produce the experiment.  This is intended for anyone who wishes to repeat the experiments.  Please bear in mind that changes (corrections and enhancements) to modules used in the experiment may affect the results.

# a 3x5 oblong grid has how many edges?
#   Each cell has 2, 3 or 4 neighbors.  There are 15 cells
#   The interior cells form a 1x3 grid      3 cells x 4 neighbors = 12 arcs
#   There are four corner cells...          4 cells x 2 neighbors =  8 arcs
#   There are 8 more cells...               8 cells x 3 neighbors = 24 arcs
#                                          ========                 =======
#                                          15 cells                 44 arcs
#   Each edge is two arcs                                           22 edges

# 2**22-1 == 4194303 -- the largest 23 digit binary number, not a problem!

m, n = 3, 5                     # dimensions
e = 22                          # number of grid edges

# Under the scheme that follows, there is a bijection from the the numbers
# from 0 through 2**22-1 into the set of simple mazes. 0 is the maze with
# no passages and 2**22-1 is the complete maze (with a passage along every
# grid edge. Not all these mazes are trees.  If we know the weight of the
# the maze and we know the weight matrix, then the binary representation
# of the weight is enough to recover the maze.

# For example, suppose the weight is 39.  In binary, we have:
#       39 = 32 + 4 + 2 + 1 or 100,111 in binary notation.
# That tells us that the maze contains the edges with weights 32, 4, 2 and 1.

# In a recent run, Prim's algorithm return a maze with weight 102,399. Since
# there are 15 cells, there should be 14 edges.  Let's find the weights:
#       N           Even or Odd?            N/2         Edge Weight
#   102,399             1                 51,199            1           1

# The weights of the 12 smallest edges sum to 4096-1=4095.  Adding this to
# the two remaining edges, we have:
#       65,536 + 32,768 + 4095 = 102,399.
# In binary, reading up:
#		11,000,111,111,111,111
#
# In another run, Prim found a spanning tree of weight 45055.  I leave it
# as an exercise to find the weights of the edges in that spanning tree.
# (There should be exactly 14 edges.)
#
# And finally, using this weighting scheme, the smallest possible weight
# of a tree is 16383.  Your task is to exaplain why that's true.
#
# Incidentally, I haven't implemented Kruskal's algorithm yet...
# (Time now: 20:40 [8:40 PM] 2 December 2024 US-EST.)
# But Kruskal's algorithm will give the same values as a correct
# implementation of Prim's algorithm.

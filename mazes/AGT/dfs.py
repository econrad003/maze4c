mazes.AGT.dfs - depth first search using the arc growing tree module

DESCRIPTION

    This module defines a method "dfs" which uses the arc-growing tree
    module and a stack to carve a maze.  The result is roughly equivalent to
    "recursive backtracker" in [1] (or vertex-based depth-first search.  The
    algorithm is implemented as a passage carver.

    In addition to method "dfs", the method "init_maze" is included to create
    an oblong grid set up for passage carving.  (The arc-growing tree algorithm
    works on arbitrary grids.)

SUMMARY

    defined here:
        method dfs - carve a maze using an arc-based depth-first search
        method init_grid - create an oblong grid and set it up for carving

    Method dfs will work on any connected grid.

CONJECTURE/SUPPOSITION -- CLAIMS TO BE TESTED

    The biases in this DFS implementation are different from those in the
    vertex-based architecture.  The differences may be subtle, but my guess
    is that the resulting mazes may differ in average diameter as a function
    of a given grid.

        One way of testing (but not proving or disproving) this claim is
        to run the two algorithms (say) 100 times on an oblong grid with
        given dimensions (e.g. 34 rows, 55 columns) and compare the sample
        means and sample standard deviations for the diameters.

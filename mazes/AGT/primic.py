FAQ

    Q: Why "primic"?
    A: Because we're mimicking Prim's algorithm.

DESCRIPTION

    This module defines a method "primic" which uses the arc-growing tree
    module and a priority queue to carve a maze.  The priorities correspond to
    arcs in a grid.  The result is an algorithm called "Arc Prim" because it
    is similar to Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum weight spanning tree.
    If the priority function is symmetric, then "Arc Prim" reduces to Prim's
    algorithm, so "Arc Prim" is actually a generalization of Prim's algorithm.

    Prim's algorithm assigns weight to edges in the grid.  If the grid is
    connected, then the result is a spanning tree whose total edge weight is
    always equal to the minimum total edge weight.  Arc Prim assigns weights to
    arcs instead of edges, so the priority function is not necessarily
    symmetric.

    The algorithm is implemented as a passage carver.

    In addition to method primic, this module defines an oblong grid
    initializer called "make_maze" and several different priority functions.

REMARKS

    Prim's algorithm is discussed on pages 175 through 179 of [1].

SUMMARY

    defined here:
        method primic - carve a maze using arc growing tree and a priority
            queue
        method init_grid - create an oblong grid and set it up for carving

    Method primic will work on any connected grid.

    In addition to the maze, an optional starting cell, and a flag to use or
    not choose neighbors randomly ("shuffle"), we have two parameters for
    the priority queue:

        action - "stable", "antistable", or "unstable" (default)
            This three-way flag sets the protocol for handling equal
            priority cells:
                "stable" - first in, first out
                "antistable" - last in, first out
                "unstable" - random
            The first letter is sufficient.  For example 's', 'S', 'Superman',
            and 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' are all treated as
            'stable'.  Similarly, 'Ultraman' and 'Underdog' are 'unstable';
            'Aquaman' and 'antimony' are 'antistable'; and 'Batman' and
            'Robin' both raise ValueError exceptions.
        pr_map - a dictionary that maps arcs to a priority.  This
            dictionary can be empty or incomplete.  The priority queue
            class assigns uniformly distributed float values in the interval
            [0,1) for any missing entries.  The keys can take several forms:
                "const" - the value is a constant
                cell - the value is the priority of the destination
                edge (frozenset) - the value is the priority of an edge as
                    in Prim's algorithm
                arc (tuple) - the value is the priority of an arc
            priorities are tried in order from specfic (arc) to general
        cache - set this to false if the priority queue cache should not be
            used.

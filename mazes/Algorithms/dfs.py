DESCRIPTION

    This is also known as 'recursive backtracker', but a recursive
    implementation is not practical because of restrictions the size of
    Python's runtime stack.

    The basic algorithm is follows:

        Push the start cell on the stack
        Loop until the stack is empty or every cell has been visited:
            pop a cell from the stack;
            if the cell hasn't been visited:
                carve a passage from the cell to the visited area;
                mark the cell as visited;
            push the cell's unvisited neighbors onto the stack.

    There are a number of different ways of doing this.  The key ambiguity is
    in the command 'carve a passage from the visited area'.  Two ways of
    implementing this are:

        (1) edge-based

            When we push a cell (other than the start cell) onto the stack,
            we keep track of its already visited neighbor.  When we carve
            the passage, we carve it from the cell to its known neighbor.

        (2) frontier-based

            When we are ready to carve a passage, we choose a visited neighbor,
            perhaps randomly, perhaps simply the first one we encounter.

IMPLEMENTATION

    We have implemented several variations:

        edge-based
            unshuffled neighborhood
            shufffled neighborhood

        frontier-based
            unshuffled neighborhood
            shufffled neighborhood

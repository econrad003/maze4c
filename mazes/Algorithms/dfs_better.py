DESCRIPTION

    This is a better implementation of the depth-first search maze carver.
    The basic algorithm is follows:

        Push the start cell on the stack and mark it as visited
        Loop until the stack is empty:
            Consider the cell at the top of the stack;
            if the cell has an unvisited neighbor:
                carve a passage from the cell to the neighbor;     [*]
                mark the neighbor as visited
                push the neighbor onto the stack;
            otherwise:
                pop the cell from the stack

    This is the algorithm that was used in the Ruby implementation of
    recursive backtracker found in [1].  It minimizes the growth of the
    stack.  It is implicitly edge-based. but see the note that follows.

    [*] If, instead of carving a passage from the cell to the selected
        neighbor, we carve a passage from the neighbor to one of the neighbor's
        visited neighbors, we have a frontier-based version of the algorithm.

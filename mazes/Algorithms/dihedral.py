DESCRIPTION

    A geometric symmetry of a shape is a continuous bijection
    which maps the shape to itself.  For example rotating the plane
    about the center of a circle through an arbitary angle is a
    symmetry of the circle:
        1) it is a continous mapping of the plane;
        2) it is one-to-one and onto the plane; and
        3) the image of the circle in the mapping is the circle
            itself.

    If we instead rotate the plane through 45 degrees about some
    point other than the center of the circle, we end up with
    a continuous bijection which fails point 3: the image of the
    circle is not the circle itself.  (It happens to be another
    circle, but that doesn't qualify.)

    This module applies symmetries of a rectangle (or a square)
    to a rectangular maze (or a square maze).
 
    A square has four rotational symmetries and four additional
    reflection symmetries.  These eight symmetries form the
    dihedral group for the square.

    A non-square rectangle has two rotational symmetries and two
    additional reflection symmetries.  These four symmetries form the
    group of symmetries for the rectangle.

    Any introduction to group theory should talk about the dihedral
    groups.  The symmetries of a rectangle are often included in the
    discussion or in the related exercises.

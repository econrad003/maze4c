DESCRIPTION

    This is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the distance
    and a shortest path between two points in a maze.  The distance algorithm
    proceeds as follows:

        Given:
            a maze, a source cell and an optional target cell;
            a function:
                weight(passage)
                    returns a non-negative value for each passage in the maze;
            a priority queue using the current distance from source.

        Result:
            Two functions:
                distance(sink)
                    returns the distance from the given source;
                via(sink)
                    returns the last step in a path from source to sink.

            If a target cell is given, these functions will not be completely
            resolved.

            If weight(passage)=1 for each passage in the maze, the distance
            function will measure the number of passages in a path from source
            to sink.

        Initialization:
            for every sink:
                distance(source, sink) = 0 if sink==source else infinity;
                via(source, sink) = None;
            place the source in the priority queue.

        Loop until the queue is empty or the target has been visited:
            remove the first cell in the priority queue;
            if it has not been visited:
                mark it as visited;
                for each passage leading to a neighbor:
                    if distance(neighbor) > distance(cell) + weight(passage):
                            # update the distance and via functions
                        distance(neighbor) = distance(cell) + weight(passage)
                        via(neighbor) = passage
                        place the neighbor in the queue

IMPLEMENTATION

    This is an instantiated class Dijkstra.

                a non-negative value.  If the value is infinite, the passage
                will be ignored.  If the value is negative, a ValueError

                weights will be assigned randomly. This option is intended

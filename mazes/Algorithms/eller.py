DESCRIPTION

    In the sidewinder algorithm, a generalization of the simple binary tree
    algorithm, we break a row into a series of runs and carve upward from each
    run.  In the top row, since we can't carve upward, we are forced to carve a
    single run.

    Eller's algorithm, invented by Martin Eller in 1982, generalizes this in a
    way that normally does not leave a single run in the top row. [1, pp 189ff]

    In the simple binary tree algorithm, we could, at least in principle, treat
    every cell as independent -- the result of a coin flip in one cell does not
    depend at all on what happens in another cell.  But the result of this
    independence are long corridors in the top row and rightmost column.  In
    sidewinder, we gain some complexity in the rightmost column, but lose cell
    independence.

    In sidewinder, we still have row independence  But the price for that is
    the long open path in the top row.  With Eller's algorithm, we pay a price
    for some complexity in the top row -- what happens in one cell can affect
    the choices made in a cell in a later row: we lose row independence.

    How does the algorithm work?  It's usually implemented as a passage carver,
    and that is how we implement it here.

    In each row, we modify what we did in sidewinder:

        a) label each new component in the row;
        b) proceeding from left to right, if a cell and its predecessor are
           in different components, toss a coin:
                head) carve a passage, or
                tail) don't;
        c) from each component in a row, carve at least one passage upward.

    If we carve exactly one passage upward each time, we have sidewinder.

    In the top or final row we discard (c) as we cannot carve upward, and we
    modify (b):

        b') proceeding from left to right, if a cell and its predecessor are
           in different components, carve a passage.

    The point of the modication is to insure that we end up with a single
    component.

    For an example, we use a 3x3 oblong grid:

        +---+---+---+
        | 1 | 2 | 3 |   (a) Row 0 - label the new components
        +---+---+---+

        +---+---+---+
        | 1   1   1 |   (b) Row 0 - merge some neighboring components
        +---+---+---+       (For this example, we merged all of them)

        +---+---+---+
        | 1 |   | 1 |
        +   +---+   +
        | 1   1   1 |   (c) Row 0 - carve up at least once per component
        +---+---+---+

        +---+---+---+
        | 1 | 4 | 1 |   (a) Row 1 - label the new components
        +   +---+   +
        | 1   1   1 |
        +---+---+---+

        +---+---+---+
        | 1 | 1   1 |   (b) Row 1 - merge some components
        +   +---+   +       We can carve (1,1)--(1,0) or (1,2)--(1,1) or
        | 1   1   1 |       do neither, but we cannot do both!
        +---+---+---+

        +---+---+---+
        | 1 | 1 |   |
        +   +   +---+
        | 1 | 1   1 |   (c) Row 1 - carve up at least once per component
        +   +---+   +
        | 1   1   1 |
        +---+---+---+

        +---+---+---+
        | 1 | 1 | 5 |   (a) Row 2 (final row) - label new components
        +   +   +---+
        | 1 | 1   1 |
        +   +---+   +
        | 1   1   1 |
        +---+---+---+

        +---+---+---+
        | 1 | 1   1 |   (b') merge components where possible
        +   +   +---+       we cannot carve (1,1)--(1,0)
        | 1 | 1   1 |       we must carve (1,2)--(1,1)
        +   +---+   +
        | 1   1   1 |

IMPLEMENTATION

    Two classes are implemented here:

        Eller - a subclass of Algorithm.

        Eller.Status - a subclass of Algorithm.Status

    In this implementation, we take the normal directions only: runs in rows
    from west to east and rises in columns from south to north.

            USAGE

                The first argument, the uncarved maze, is passed as the
                first argument to the constructor (__init__ in class
                Algorithm.Status).  Method parse_args is called by the
                constructor with any remaining arguments.

                The remaining arguments are processed here.

            KEYWORD ARGUMENTS

                onward - the onward compass direction

                upward - the upward direction direction

                flip1 - the coin toss handler for merging two adjacent cells
                    in the same row.  The default is a fair coin.

                flip2 - the coin toss handler for optional upward carving. The
                default is a head in 1 of 3 tosses, or equivalently 1:2 odds
                for head:tail.

                    The method handlers for flip1 and flip2.are provided with
                    two required arguments, namely the cells whose components
                    may be merged.  These, along with any optional arguments
                    and any keyword arguments except "bias", are ignored.

                required_choice - the handler for required upward carving.  The
                    method handler is provided a run consisting of (cell,nbr)
                    pairs with cell in the current row (or column, or more
                    generally: tier) and nbr its grid neighbor in the next tier.

                    The method handlers for flip1, flip2, and required choice
                    are triples (name, args, kwargs) consisting of:
                        name - a method name;
                        args - a tuple listing and additional named or
                            optional arguments;
                        kwargs - a dictionary which supplies keyword arguments.
                    The default method for flip1 and flip2 is the procedure
                    coin_toss defined immediately after the Eller module
                    docstring.  The default method for required_choice is
                    procedure select_pair defined after coin_toss.

                debug - display some informative messages indicating what
                    is going on.  If False or 0, no simply informative messages
                    are displayed.  If True or 1, messages tracking row state
                    are displayed.  Higher values will display additional
                    messages.  For example, a value of 5 will also trace merges
                    and a value of 10 will print all of the trace messages.

                    To suppress the warning messages as well as the informative
                    messages, use a value of -10.  The warnings detect
                    connectivity problems that can occur if the the grid is
                    configured in an unusual way or if some cells have been
                    masked.

                    (At this point in time, the author does not plan to use
                    Python's logging module for these messages.)

DESCRIPTION

    This is an implementation of a hybrid random walk maze carver, which
    Jamis Buck refers to this in [3] as Houston's algorithm .  The algorithm
    was suggested in Buck's blog in a response by Robin Houston dated 20
    January 2011.  From the followup the next day, it is not known whether
    the resulting maze is uniform.

    The basic algorithm is as follows:

        Use first-entrance Aldous/Broder until the size of the unvisited area
        falls below a given threshold;  then use Wilson's algorithm to complete
        the maze.

NOTES

    If the grid is not connected, the algorithm (and its implementation here)
    will not terrminate,

    Even if the grid is connected, the algorithm (and its implementation here)
    might not terminate.  The actual probability of this is quite low.
    (The probability for the algorithm is zero.  Whether it can actually happen
    with this implementation is unknown.)  There is no practical way of
    distinguishing between a very slow run and a run that will never terminate.

    Houston's algorithm takes advantage of ALdous/Broder's initial quick
    capture of are and Wilson's algorithm speedy finish when most of the maze
    is complete.

IMPLEMENTATION

    The class Houston is built on the Algorithm class in the usual way.
    Run the implementation as:
        status = Houston.on(maze)
    See method parse_args() in Wilson.Status for optional arguments.

    Most of the code here was lifted from my implementation of the
    Aldous/Broder and Wilson classes.

DESCRIPTION

    This is an implementation of the hunt and kill maze carving algorithm.
    The algorithm is as follows:

        Preparation:
            get a list of cells to be visited;
            choose a starting cell and remove it from the unvisited set;
            the starting cell is now the current cell.

        Loop until every cell has been visited:
            if the current cell has an unvisited neighbor:
                        (kill)
                choose a random unvisited neighbor of the current cell;
                carve a passage between the cell and this neighbor;
                now the neighbor is the current cell;
            otherwise:
                        (hunt)
                choose a random unvisited cell that has a visited neighbor;
                carve a passage from the cell to a visited neighbor.
                now the cell is the current cell.

    (See [1], pages 67-71 and 251.

NOTES

    If the grid is not connected, the algorithm (and its implementation here)
    will not terrminate,

    Even if the grid is connected, the algorithm (and its implementation here)
    might not terminate.  The actual probability of this is quite low.
    (The probability for the algorithm is zero.  Whether it can actually happen
    with this implementation is unknown.)  There is no practical way of
    distinguishing between a very slow run and a run that will never terminate.

IMPLEMENTATION

    The class AldousBroder is built on the Algorithm class in the usual way.
    Run the implementation as:
        status = AldousBroder.on(maze)
    See method parse_args() in AldousBroder.Status for optional arguments.

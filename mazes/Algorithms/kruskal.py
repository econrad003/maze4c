DESCRIPTION

    Kruskal's algorithm, like Prim's algorithm, is a minimum weight spanning
    tree algorithm.  Like the more general growing tree family of algorithms,
    Kruskal's algorithm has variants that also produce spanning trees for
    connected graphs. When the initial graph is not connected, Kruskal's
    algorithms and its variants produce maximal spanning forests (with
    spanning trees in each component).

BASIC ALGORITHM

    Given: an edge weight map.

    Initialization:
       Place the edges in a priority queue.
       Number the components.  (Initially, the maze [or graph]) is emmpty, so
            each component is an isolated cell [or vertex].)

    Loop:
        While the queue is not empty:
            remove an edge from the queue; [this will be a lowest weight edge]
            if the edge is incident to two components:
                carve the associated passage
                    [this will join the two components]
                (merge the components)
            otherwise:
                do nothing

    Notes:

        (a) If k0 is the number of cells (or more generally, the number of
        components at start, then the loop can terminate as soon as k-1 edges
        have been added.

        (b) The algorithm can be used to extend a disconnected subgraph to a
        minimally connected subgraph by adding edges of minimal total weight.

        (c) If we don't care about edge weights, we can use any type of queue.

        (d) Growing tree algorithms are related to search processes.  Kruskal's
        algorithm and its variants are connected to sorting processes.

                maze - handled by __init__ in the base class.

            KEYWORD ARGUMENTS

                setup - a startup procedure.  This may be  one of the strings
                    'scatter' or 'collect', or a function whose input is a
                    maze and its return value is an instance of class
                    ComponentRegistry (defined in module mazes.components).
                    The default is 'collect'.

                        'scatter' - returns a registry in which each component
                            is a single cell.

                        'collect' - collects cells into connected components.
                            If the initialize maze has no passages, this is the
                            same as 'scatter'.

                shuffle - if False, grid edges are entered directly into the
                    queue without shuffling; if True, they are shuffled before
                    entry.  The default is False.

                QueueClass - a generalized queueing class defined
                    using class GeneralizedQueue from mazes.gqueue.
                    The default is PriorityQueue.

                priority - a lookup function which maps a cell to a
                    priority (e.g. for VertexPrim).  If this is provided,
                    the priority will be passed to enter using the keyword
                    priority, e.g.:
                        q.enter(cell, priority=priority(cell))

                init -- arguments to be used in initializing QueueClass.
                    These take the form of a list or a tuple consisting of a
                    tuple and a dictionary, i.e. (args, kwargs).  The queue
                    class is then initialized as:

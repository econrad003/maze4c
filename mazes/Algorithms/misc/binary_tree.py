DESCRIPTION

    This module adapts the simple binary tree algorithm to a number of
    special grids.  Each adaptation is built in its own class and each
    is kept as simple as is reasonable.  To add features, try writing
    a subclass.

    In the simple binary tree algorithm, cells (in principle) are processed
    in parallel. In each cell where there is a choice, a coin is tossed.  If
    the coin is a head, the rule is to carve a passage northward.  If the
    toss is a tail, the result is carving eastward.

    The result on an oblong grid is a rooted binary tree with the northeast
    corner as an obvious root.  There is a continuous east-west corridor along
    the north boundary wall and a continuous north-south corridor along the
    east boundary wall.  To find a path between two cells, simply go north or
    east from each cell to eventuall arrive in the northeast corner -- follow
    one of these paths until the two paths meet, and then trace the second path
    back to its source.

IMPLEMENTATION

    The following classes are implemented here:

        CylinderMaze - create a simple binary tree on a cylinder maze.

class OneShot(object):
    """the base (stub)

    DESCRIPTION

        Two calls are required to carve a maze.  The constructor is
        called to create an object which contains the maze and,
        ultimately, the algorithm status.  Then the "on" method
        is called to run the algorithm and return the status.  The
        usage pattern is:

            obj = OneShot(GridClass, *args, **kwargs)  # create maze
            status = obj.on(status, *args, **kwargs)   # carve maze

        This class is a stub, so the real way to do this is to create
        a subclass which has its own __init__ method and supplies
        the correct grid class and parameters.  Here is a minimal
        nonworking implementation using a hypothethical grid class:

            class Subclass(OneShot):
                class Status(OneShot.Status):
                    pass        # modifications go here
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    from mazes.foobar import FooGrid
                    super().__init__(FooGrid, *args, **kwargs)

        The calling sequence becomes:

            obj = Subclass(*args, **kwargs)     # create FooGrid maze
            status = obj.on(*args, **kwargs)    # carve maze

        Calling the "on" method a second time will raise a RuntimeError
        exception.

    __slots__ = ("__maze", "__status", "__once")

    class Status(Algorithm.Status):
        """Simple binary tree status(stub)

                    *** BRIEFLY, HOW TO USE THIS ***

        First, read the description in the OneShot class docstring.

        Most of the work is done here.  This should be subclassed to
        fine tune the algorithm.  The can_go_onward, can_go_upward, and
        parse_args methods will likely need to be overriden.

        The subclass should normally provide the correct onward and
        upward directions, and the correct bias using the
        super().parse_args method.  In more difficult cases, the
        onward, upward, and bias properties might need to be
        overridden.

        Any preprocessing can be done in initialize and configure
        methods.

        For an example, see the Cylinder class and the Cylinder.Status
        class below.

class Cylinder(OneShot):
    """carves a cylindrical maze using the simple binary tree algorithm

    DESCRIPTION

        If we naively use the simple binary tree algorithm on a
        cylindrical grid obtained by identifying a pair of opposite
        sides of a 4-connected rectangular grid, we will not
        produce a perfect maze.  The maze will necessarily contain
        a circuit, and it will not necessarily be connected.

        Suppose we identify the left and right edges of our fundamental
        rectangle and in carving, our carving choices are right and up.
        Then (1) in the top row, since we cannot carve upward and can
        always carve rightward, we will necessarily end up with a
        circuit in the top row.  This is enough to guarantee that the
        resulting maze is imperfect.  In particular, it cannot be a
        tree.  (2) In some other row, if for each cell, there is a
        chance that we might might carve rightward, then there is
        a chance that we might carve rightward in every cell in the
        row.  In addition to creating a circuit, as there is no
        way to reach the cells above from this row, the maze is
        disconnected.

        The fix for both problems is quite simple.  In each row, we
        must designate a cell where we cannot carve to the right.
        The designated cell in the top row is special, in that
        we can reach it from every cell by simply following a path
        using a mix of leftward and upward steps.

        If our cylinder was produced by identifying the top and bottom
        sides, then in each column, we require a barrier cell where we
        cannot carve upward.

    USAGE

        There are two steps.

            (1) Create the maze object:

                    cylinder = Cylinder(rows, cols, parity=False/True])

                The empty maze object will be:

                    cylinder.maze

            (2) Carve the maze:

                    cylinder.on([bias=0.5/BIAS, reverse=False/True])

                The carved maze is cylinder.maze.  The status object is
                returned and can be retrived separately as
                cylinder.status.

        We have two types of barriers.  One type blocks the onward

        The rules for barriers are as follows:

            1) each row contains exactly one type-1 barrier;
            2) each column contains exactly one type-2 barrier; and

DESCRIPTION

    This is an implementation of a first entrance random walk maze carver
    with multiple threads,  It is a generalization of the Aldous/Broder
    first entrance random walk algorithm.  With a single thread, the
    algorithm reduces to Aldous/Broder. The underlying algorithm is
    as follows:

        Preparation:
            get a list of cells to be visited;
            choose a starting cell and remove it from the unvisited set;
            the starting cell is now the current cell.

        Loop until every cell has been visited:
            choose a random neighbor of the current cell;
            if this neighbor has not been visited:
                (this is a first entrance!)
                remove the neighbor from the unvisited set
                carve a passage from the current cell to the neighbor;
            now the neighbor is the current cell.

    For the multi-threaded version, in addition to the overall visited
    set, for each thread, there is a "claimed set", the set of cells
    claimed by that thread.

        Preparation:
            get a list of cells to be visited.
            for each thread:
                choose a starting cell and remove it from the unvisited set;
                add it to the thread's claimed set;
                it is now the current cell for the thread.

        Loop until all cells are visited and all but one thread have closed:
            choose a thread (called thread A) to be active;
            choose a random neighbor of the current cell;
            if this neighbor has been claimed by another thread (called thread I):
                carve a passage from the current cell to the neighbor;
                add all cells claimed by thread A to the claimed set for I;
                thread A's claimed set is now empty;
                if all cells have been visited:
                    close thread A
                else:
                    choose a starting cell and remove it from the unvisited set;
                    add it to thread A's claimed set;
                    it is now the current cell for thread A;
            else:
                (this neighbor is either claimed by thread A or unclaimed)
                if this neighbor has not been visited:
                    (this is a first entrance!)
                    remove the neighbor from the unvisited set
                    carve a passage from the current cell to the neighbor;
                    add the neighbor to thread A's claimed set
                now the neighbor is the current cell

    As with Aldous/Broder, there is an assumption here.  With a bad random
    sequence, the algorithm will never finish.

    For all but one thread to close, it is necessary that the grid be
    connected.

QUESTIONS

    I doubt that the algorithm produces uniform spanning trees except in
    trivial case (with 1 thread).  But I don't have a proof, and I don't
    have any suspicions about the biases.  So the questions are:

        1) Is the algorithm unbiased?

        2) If the algorithm is biased, then is there a characterization
           of the bias?

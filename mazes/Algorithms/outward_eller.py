            USAGE

                The first argument, the uncarved maze, is passed as the
                first argument to the constructor (__init__ in class
                Algorithm.Status).  Method parse_args is called by the
                constructor with any remaining arguments.

                The remaining arguments are processed here.

            KEYWORD ARGUMENTS

                onward - clockwise (default) or counterclockwise

                flip1 - the coin toss handler for merging two adjacent cells
                    in the same row.  The default is a fair coin.

                flip2 - the coin toss handler for optional upward carving. The
                default is a head in 1 of 3 tosses, or equivalently 1:2 odds
                for head:tail.

                    The method handlers for flip1 and flip2.are provided with
                    two required arguments, namely the cells whose components
                    may be merged.  These, along with any optional arguments
                    and any keyword arguments except "bias", are ignored.

                required_choice - the handler for required upward carving.  The
                    method handler is provided a run consisting of (cell,nbr)
                    pairs with cell in the current row (or column, or more
                    generally: tier) and nbr its grid neighbor in the next tier.

                    The method handlers for flip1, flip2, and required choice
                    are triples (name, args, kwargs) consisting of:
                        name - a method name;
                        args - a tuple listing and additional named or
                            optional arguments;
                        kwargs - a dictionary which supplies keyword arguments.
                    The default method for flip1 and flip2 is the procedure
                    coin_toss defined immediately after the Eller module
                    docstring.  The default method for required_choice is
                    procedure select_pair defined after coin_toss.

                debug - display some informative messages indicating what
                    is going on.  If False or 0, no simply informative messages
                    are displayed.  If True or 1, messages tracking row state
                    are displayed.  Higher values will display additional
                    messages.  For example, a value of 5 will also trace merges
                    and a value of 10 will print all of the trace messages.

                    To suppress the warning messages as well as the informative
                    messages, use a value of -10.  The warnings detect
                    connectivity problems that can occur if the the grid is
                    configured in an unusual way or if some cells have been
                    masked.

                    (At this point in time, the author does not plan to use
                    Python's logging module for these messages.)

DESCRIPTION

    The outwinder algorithm, like its sibling inwinder, is a variation of
    the sidewinder algorithm.

    In sidewinder, we divide a row into runs and in each run, we carve
    one passage north to the next row. Of course, a symmetry argument
    indicates that we could instead carve southward from each run instead
    of northward.  Another symmetry argument tells us that we could
    divide a column into rises and from each rise, carve a passage eastward.

    Outwinder is an application of the same  algorithm.  As in inwinder, we
    divide the oblong grid into a sequence of rectangular rings, each ring
    being a fixed number of cells in taxicab distance from the perimeter of
    the oblong.  Again as in inwinder, we divide each ring into a sequence
    of consecutive runs.  From each run, we choose a cell to carve a passage
    outward.  (Note that with a corner cell, we have two outward neighbors to
    choose from.  The availability of outward neighbors from the corners
    makes outwinder a bit simpler than inwinder.)

IMPLEMENTATION

    Two classes are implemented here:

        Outwinder - a subclass of Algorithm.

        Outwinder.Status - a subclass of Algorithm.Status

    In addition, two default methods are defined.  The first is the following
    default coin flip method is defined:

        result = cointoss(cell, bias=0.5)

    The second method is a run choice method:

        cell, nbr = run_choice(run, which=None)

    These are identical to those defined in the sidewinder implementation.
    They are described below in method Outwinder.Status.parse_args.

            KEYWORD ARGUMENTS

                flip - the coin toss method

                    Flip takes cell a bias and returns a boolean: True or
                    False represents a head or a tail, respectively.  The
                    default is method 'coin_toss' defined above.  The cell
                    is ignored in the default method.

                bias - the probability of a head

                    The bias is passed as a keyword argument to the flip
                    method

                choose_in_run - the method used to choose a cell-neighbor
                    pair from a run.  It takes a run and 'which' and returns
                    an entry in the run.  The default is the method
                    'run_choice' defined above.

                which - a keyword parameter used to decide how the run choice
                    method picks an entry.  The default method 'run_choice'
                    admits three types of input:
                        (i) a tuple or list of integers:
                            one of these integers is chosen and used as in (ii)
                        (ii) a list index, so, for example, 0 represents the
                            first entry, 1 the second, -1 the last
                        (iii) anything that fails as a list integer, i.e. a
                            non-integer (e.g. None or any) or an integer
                            which raises an IndexError exception, results in
                            a uniform choice from the entire run.

DESCRIPTION

    This is an implementation of the last exit random walk maze carver,
    or (simply) reverse Aldous/Broder.  The algorithm is as follows:

        Preparation:
            get a list of cells to be visited;
            choose a starting cell and remove it from the unvisited set;
            the starting cell is now the current cell;
            initialize an asssociative array "tentative exits".

        Loop until every cell has been visited:
            choose a random neighbor of the current cell;
            if this neighbor has not been visited:
                (this is a first entrance!)
                remove the neighbor from the unvisited set
            set the tentative exit from the current cell to the neighbor;
            now the neighbor is the current cell.

        Loop through all cells in the tentative exit list:
            carve a passage from the cell to its neighbor in the list.

    The algorithm is a modified version of the Aldous/Broder first entrance
    random walk.  If the random choices are uniformly random, then the result
    is also a uniformly random spanning tree.

    When implemented as a passage carver (as described above), the algorithm
    has some extra overhead, but it's time complexity is asymptoticly the
    same as for its first entrance counterpart.

NOTES

    If the grid is not connected, the algorithm (and its implementation here)
    will not terrminate,

    Even if the grid is connected, the algorithm (and its implementation here)
    might not terminate.  The actual probability of this is quite low.
    (The probability for the algorithm is zero.  Whether it can actually happen
    with this implementation is unknown.)  There is no practical way of
    distinguishing between a very slow run and a run that will never terminate.

IMPLEMENTATION

    The class ReverseAldousBroder is built on the Algorithm class with a small
    modification.  Run the implementation in the usual way as:
        status = ReverseAldousBroder.on(maze)
    See method parse_args() in ReverseAldousBroder.Status for optional
    arguments.

    The "on" classmethod in the algorithm has been modified to include an after
    action ("afterwards") that takes place after the last "visit".

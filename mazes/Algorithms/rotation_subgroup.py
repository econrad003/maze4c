mazes.Algorithms.rotation_subgroup - rotation group for rectangle or square

DESCRIPTION

    The rotation group for a square consists of four rotations,
    including the identity, two ninety-degree rotations, and
    one reflection.  For a general rectangle, the two ninety-degree
    rotations are excluded as they don't map the rectangle onto
    itself.

REFERENCES

    Any introduction to group theory should talk about the dihedral
    groups.  The symmetries of a rectangle are often included in the
    discussion or in the related exercises.  The rotation subgroup
    of a dihedral group omit the reflections -- as the name indicates,
    only rotations are admitted.

DESCRIPTION

    In the sidewinder algorithm, rows (in principle) are processed in parallel.
    The algorithm is a generalization of the simple binary tree algorithm.
    In each cell where there is a choice, a coin is tossed.  If the
    coin is a head, the rule is to carve a passage northward from somewhere
    in the east-west run containing the cell.  In the event of a tail, the
    response is to extend the current run eastward.  The spanning tree that is
    returned is not in general a binary tree as degree 4 cells can be created
    when carving northward.

    Sidewinder is a true generalization of the simple binary tree algorithm:
    if we always choose the last cell in a run when carving northward, the
    algorithm reduces to simple binary tree.  If, instead, we always choose the
    first cell, the algorithm reduces to a west/north simple binary tree (where
    we carve westward instead of eastward).  If we always choose either the
    first or the last entry in the run, the result is a binary spanning tree
    which generalizes the east/north and west/north binary trees.

    The result on an oblong grid is a spanning tree with a continuous east-west
    corridor along the north boundary wall.  To find a path between two cells,
    simply go north whenever possible or east otherwise until the north
    corridor is reached.  Follow one of these paths until the two paths either
    meet or they end in the north corridor, and then trace the second path
    back to its source.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Two classes are implemented here:

        Sidewinder - a subclass of Algorithm.

        Sidewinder.Status - a subclass of Algorithm.Status

    In addition, two default methods are defined.  The first is the following
    default coin flip method is defined:

        result = cointoss(cell, bias=0.5, **kwargs)

    The return value is a boolean, True for a head or false for a Tail.  The
    cell argument is ignored.  If a uniformly random value (rng.random()) is less
    than the bias, the result is a head.

    The second method is a run choice method:

        cell, nbr = run_choice(run, which=None, **kwargs)

    The value of 'which' can be the constant None or an integer.  If the
    integer is -1, the last run entry is chosen; if 0, the first entry.  If
    the value is None, the choice is uniformly random.  Integers are
    tried once -- if the integer is not a valid index, then the default
    (None) will be used.  Tuples of integers can also be entered -- in this
    case, a choice will be made from the tuple and tried as the index -- for
    example (0, -1) randomly chooses the first or last element.

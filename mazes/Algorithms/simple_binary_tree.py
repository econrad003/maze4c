DESCRIPTION

    In the simple binary tree algorithm, cells (in principle) are processed
    in parallel. In each cell where there is a choice, a coin is tossed.  If
    the coin is a head, the rule is to carve a passage northward.  If the
    toss is a tail, the result is carving eastward.

    The result on an oblong grid is a rooted binary tree with the northeast
    corner as an obvious root.  There is a continuous east-west corridor along
    the north boundary wall and a continuous north-south corridor along the
    east boundary wall.  To find a path between two cells, simply go north or
    east from each cell to eventuall arrive in the northeast corner -- follow
    one of these paths until the two paths meet, and then trace the second path
    back to its source.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Two classes are implemented here:

        BinaryTree - a subclass of Algorithm.

        BinartTree.Status - a subclass of Algorithm.Status

    In addition, the following default coin flip method is defined:

        result = cointoss(cell, bias=0.5, **kwargs)

    The return value is a boolean, True for a head or false for a Tail.  The
    cell argument is ignored.  If a uniformly random value (rng.random()) is
    less than the bias, the result is a head.

            KEYWORD ARGUMENTS

                onward - the onward direction (tail). The default is "east".

                upward - the upward direction (head). The default is "north".

                flip - a function which takes a cell and some keyword arguments
                    as input and returns a boolean value: True for a head and
                    False for a tail.  The default is method 'cointoss' defined
                    above.

            KEYWORD ARGUMENTS

                name - handled by __init__ in the base class.

                bias - the probability of a head.  The default is 0.5 in
                    'cointoss'.  This argument is passed to flip, if present.

                **kwargs
                    all other keyword arguments are passed to the coin flip
                    subroutine.

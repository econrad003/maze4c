mazes.Algorithm.simplified_Prim - a growing tree algorithm that is
    superficially similar to Prim's algorithm.

DESCRIPTION

    The algorithm is described on pages 179-181 of the Jamis Buck book.  It
    is a growing tree algorithm that is sometimes incorrectly called Prim's
    algorithm.

    The basic algorithm is follows:

        Mark the start cell as active and visited.
        Loop until there are no active cells:
            choose a random active cell;
            if the cell has an unvisited neighbor:
                carve a passage from the cell to the neighbor;
                mark the neighbor as active and visited;
            otherwise:
                remove the cell from the active list.

    The similarities between this algorithm, DFS, and BFS striking.  All three
    along with Prim's algorithm (the real Prim's algorithm) are growing tree
    algorithms.  The name is appropriate as we start with a single cell and
    expand the maze like a tree's root system.  (We might also call them
    mycelial network algorithms as they grow a maze much like the growth of
    a mycelial network that supports a fungus.)

DESCRIPTION

    This is an implementation of the circuit-eliminated random walk maze
    carver, or (simply) Wilson's algorithm.  The algorithm is as follows:

        Preparation:
            get a list of cells to be visited;
            choose a starting cell and remove it from the unvisited set;

        Loop until every cell has been visited:
            choose a random cell in the unvisited area as the current cell;
            the walk := [cell]
                    (the random walk)
            while the current cell has not been visited:
                choose one of its neighborsl
                if the neighbor has not been visited:
                    if the neighbor is in the walk:
                                (circuit elimination)
                        remove all cells added since the neighbor was added;
                    otherwise:
                        add the neighbor to the walk
                now the neighbor is the current cell
            add the walk to the maze

    The algorithm is named after David Wilson who discovered the algorithm.
    If the random choices are uniformly random, then the result is a uniformly
    random spanning tree.

NOTES

    If the grid is not connected, the algorithm (and its implementation here)
    will not terrminate,

    Even if the grid is connected, the algorithm (and its implementation here)
    might not terminate.  The actual probability of this is quite low.
    (The probability for the algorithm is zero.  Whether it can actually happen
    with this implementation is unknown.)  There is no practical way of
    distinguishing between a very slow run and a run that will never terminate.

    Unlike Aldous/Broder, Wilson's algorithm tends to be slow at first and
    to speed up as more cells are visited.

    In [1], circuits are referred to as loops.  We reserve the term "loop" for
    a trivial circuit.  Terminology varies.  There is no point in arguing over
    it.  Just get used to the fact.

IMPLEMENTATION

    The class Wilson is built on the Algorithm class in the usual way.
    Run the implementation as:
        status = Wilson.on(maze)
    See method parse_args() in Wilson.Status for optional arguments.

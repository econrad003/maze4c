DESCRIPTION

    This module is an inderface for producing simple turtle graphics using
    the matplotlib graphics library.  There is a single class defined here:

        Spider - logo-style turtle graphics (FYI: turtles are cool but
            I like spiders, and with mazes, a spider web is an appropriate
            analogy.)

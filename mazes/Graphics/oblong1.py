DESCRIPTION

    This module mimics the string form for an oblong grid using matplotlib
    and the spider graphics driver.  It does not support one-way connections
    or insets. One class is defined:

        Pholcidae -- named after the family of daddy long-leg spiders.

    The daddy long-legs spider has long somewhat clumsy legs.  This driver
    works well for mazes defined on oblong grids provided all passages are
    undirected and the only exits from a cell are to its north, south, east
    and west neighbors.  The passages are wide with no insets, perfect for
    the daddy long-legs to seek its prey.  Simplicity is the order of the
    day.

"""
mazes.Graphics.polar2 - another simple graphics driver for the theta grid

DESCRIPTION

    This module plots the edges and arcs of a theta maze using matplotlib
    and the spider graphics driver.  It supports one-way and diagonal
    connections. Parallel edges are not supported.  In addition, edges and arcs
    between cells that are not geometrically one unit away orthogonally or
    diagonally will simply make a mess.  In particular, weaving and gluing are
    not supported.  The resulting maze has a weblike structure -- as with its
    oblong counterpart we call the class SpiderWeb.

    The idea is from a suggestion found on Jamis Buck's web blog.  In an
    article [1] on how to create Minecraft-like mazes, he begins the
    discussion with:

        Once you start playing with mazes, you soon discover that there are a
        lot of different ways to draw them. The easiest way is what I call a
        linewise rendering, and ...

    So this driver produces linewise mazes.  In mathematical terms, if the maze
    is undirected, with no loops and no parallel edges, then viewed as a simple
    graph, we are representing the graphic matroid.  If we try to sketch an
    empty maze using this driver, we just get a blank image.

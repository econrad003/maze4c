mazes.Grids.oblong_rings - for iterating oblong grids using concentric rectangles

DESCRIPTION

    There are many ways of iterating through the cells of an oblong grid.  The
    first way is randomly -- shuffle the list of cells and iterate through the
    shuffled list.  For an m by n oblong grid, this yields
        (mn)! = (mn) (mn-1) (mn-2) ... (3) (2) (1) possible iterations,
    which, as the values of m and n grow, will soon exceed the possible
    shuffles produced by a pseudo-random number generator.  A 2x5 grid with 10
    cells has 10!=3,628,800 possible shuffles.  Moving to a grid with just twice
    as many cells (i.e. 20 cells: e.g. 4x5, 2x10), we have:
        20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000 shuffles
    or more than 2 quintillion (US; see note [a]).  Going up just 10 more cells
    (to 30 cells, e.g. 5x6, 3x10):
        30! = 265,252,859,812,191,058,636,308,480,000,000 shuffles
    (> 265 nonillion US; > 265 quintillion UK/FR).

    More practically, the usual approaches are row major or column major with
    rows and or columns taken in ascending or descending order.  These yield
    just 2x2x2=8 of the possible shuffles.  More shuffles can be obtained
    by varying the choice of direction (ascending/descending) in the inner
    tier.  For a 4x5 rectangle, we have:
        2 x 2^5 = 64 possibilities for row major shuffles
        2 x 2^4 = 32 possibilities for column major shuffles
    for a total of 96 shuflles.

    Now consider the following 4x5 matrix:

        4  5  6  7  8
        3 16 17 18  9
        2 15 20 19 10
        1 14 13 12 11

    Here the entries are arranged in two concentric rectangles.  Entries in the
    outer rectangle are numbered from 1 through 14 clockwise starting in the
    southwest corner.  The inner rectangle is numbered from 15 through 20
    clockwise from the southwest.  We could have let the numbers run
    counterclockwise, and the choice of the southwest corner was arbitrary.
    For the outer rectangle, we have:
        2 x 14 = 28 possible orderings
    For the inner rectangle, we have:
        2 x 6 = 12 possible ordering
    And we could order from inside outward for a total of:
        2 x (2 x (14+6)) = 80 possible shuffles.

    For example if we start in the inner rectangle (working outward) and
    number the inner rectangle counterclocwise from bottom center, and the
    outer rectangle clockwise from the southwest, as before, we have:

        10 11 12 13 14
         9  3  4  5 15
         8  2  1  6 16
         7 20 19 18 17

    This module implements concentric rectangular tiers.

NOTES

    [a] In the US, high order groups go up in threes:
            million, billion, trillion, quadrillion, quintillion, etc.
        In the UK and France, an older grouping of sixes is still (sometimes)
        in use:
            million/milliard; billion/billiard, trillion/trilliard, etc.
        Using the latter: 20! is between 2 and 3 trillion.
        Either way, that's a lot of shuffles. [see note b]

    [b] For a standard deck of 52 cards (4 suits, 13 ranks, no jokers) there are:
            52! = 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,
                     975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000
        distinct shuffles.  In about 5 centuries of playing cards, we aren't
        even close to achieving that many games.
        A standard year is 31,556,952 seconds. Let's round that up to 32,000,000.
        If each of 7 billion-US people played a game of solitaire every second
        for 500 years, we would have:
            7,000,000,000 x 500 x 32,000,000 = 1120 x 1,000,000,000,000,000
                = 1,120,000,000,000,000,000 games.
        Not even close!  Not even a drop in a bucket!

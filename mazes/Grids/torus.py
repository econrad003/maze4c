DESCRIPTION

    A toroidal grid is an oblong grid (Von Neumann neighborhood) in
    which the westmost cells have east-west grid connections with the
    eastmost cells, and the southmost cells have north-south grid
    connections with the cells in the northmost row.  One can visualize
    this by taping opposite ends of a strip of newspaper without
    twisting the strip to form a cylinder; then joining the two circular
    ends, creasing slightly as needed but not twisting the cylinder.

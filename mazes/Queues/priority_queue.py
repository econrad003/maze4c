mazes.Queues.priority_queue - implementation of a priority queue using
    generalized queues

DESCRIPTION

    Implemented here is class PriorityQueue.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

    Here we use Python module 'heapq' to implement our priority queue.  There
    is a major drawback to heapq as it does not work with data that
    is not comparable.  We accordingly use a tuple to represent the priority.
    There are three options:
        "stable" - (priority, index)
            index is simply an integer which increases by 1 each time a
            packet is placed on the queue.  The effect is to create a stable
            queue as equal priority items are ordered in order of entry.
        "antistable" - (priority, -index)
            Here we decrease the index by 1 with each entry, so that equal
            priority packets are ordered in reverse entry order.
        "unstable" - (priority, random, index)
            Here equal priority items are ordered randomly.  To guard against
            problems with random number generation, we throw in a unique
            index.
    The option is specified using the keyword 'action' and the action can
    be abbreviated as 's', 'a', 'u'.

    The priority lookup function is specified using the 'priority' keyword.
    If the lookup returns the value None, then a value created and cached
    in a dictionary.  (This will fail if the packet is not hashable.)  The
    option 'cache=False' can be used to suppress caching.

    As an alternative, a priority can also be supplied when a packet is
    entered.  This is more suitable for algorithms (such as discrete event
    simulations) where priorities are created on the fly.

mazes.VGT.dfs - depth first search using the vertex growing tree module

Copyright Â©2024 by Eric Conrad.  Licensed under GPL.v3.

DESCRIPTION

    This module defines a method "dfs" which uses the vertex-growing tree
    module and a stack to carve a maze.  The result is equivalent to
    depth-first search as implemented in mazes.Algorithms.dfs_better.
    The algorithm is implemented as a passage carver.

    In [1], depth-first search (or DFS) is called 'recursive backtracker'.

    In addition to method "dfs", the method "init_maze" is included to create
    an oblong grid set up for passage carving.  (The growing tree algorithm
    works on arbitrary grids.)

SUMMARY

    defined here:
        method dfs - carve a maze using depth-first search
        method init_grid - create an oblong grid and set it up for carving

    Method dfs will work on any connected grid.

mazes.active_list - base class implementation for active lists

Copyright Â©2024 by Eric Conrad.  Licensed under GPL.v3.

DESCRIPTION

    An active list is an array in which arbitrary members can be quickly
    removed at random.  In [1], this sort of structure is implied in
    the discussion SimplifiedPrims and GrowingTree.

    The price we pay is that deletions from anywhere but the end reorder the
    entries in the array.

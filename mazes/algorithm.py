mazes.algorithm - base class implementation for maze generation algorithms

DESCRIPTION

    A maze is an undirected graph which defines passages between cells.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Two classes are implemented here:

        Algorithm - contains a single class method 'on'  In most cases
            this should be adequate for maze generation.

        Algorithm.Status - in most cases, subclassing this is all that is
            required.  The following methods should be overridden as needed:
                parse_args
                initialize
                configure
                visit
            To force a visit, include the following in method 'initialize':
                self.more = True
            Method 'visit' should include logic to decide when no further
            visits are required.  To stop further visits:
                self.more = False
            Statistics are name value pairs. The name should be a string and
            the value should be an int, a float, or a string.  The title
            in the first line can be changed using the 'name' option.  A
            default value can be set as a class constant NAME.

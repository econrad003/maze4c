        OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

            label - a string or an integer.  This value can be changed.

            weight - a number (default=1).  This value can be changed

            no_loops - a boolean (default=True).  If False, loops are
                admissible.  If True, a loop will raise a ValueError exception.

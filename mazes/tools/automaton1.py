mazes.tools.automataton1 - a simple cellular automaton for an oblong grid

DESCRIPTION

    Our automaton assumes a Von Neuman neighborhood and uses two rules:

        Rule B: A dead cell is born if it has 1, 2 or 3 live neighbors.

        Rule D: A live cell dies if it has 0 or 4 live neighbors.

    Note that cells along the perimeter can be born but cannot die.

    Also note that we could simplify the rule set by simply saying that a cell
    will live if and only if it has 1, 2 or 3 live neighbors.  To allow play
    with other systems of neighborhoods, we won't make this simplification.

    Our program interprets these rules very literally.  If given a grid
    containing a live cell with five live neighbors, that cell will remain
    alive since 5 is not in {0, 4}.

    Changes of state happen synchronously.

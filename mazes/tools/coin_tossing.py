mazes.tools.coin_tossing - methods that simulate different kinds of coins

DESCRIPTION

    Several methods are implemented here to handle various coin-tossing
    scenarios.  Common to all is a method that returns either True to
    represent a head or False to represent a tail.

    The implemented methods are:

        cointoss(*args, bias=0.5, **kwargs)
            returns a head with Bernoulli probability p=bias

        all_heads(*args, **kwargs)
            always returns a head (True)

        all_tails(*args, **kwargs)
            always returns a tail

        remote_control(*args, f:callable=coin_toss, **kwargs)
            returns f(*args, **kwargs)
            (if f is not specified, the behavior is the same as coin_toss)

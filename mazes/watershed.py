mazes.watershed - divide a grid into several wetlands/swamps/bogs

DESCRIPTION

    Here we take a connected grid and partition it into several connected
    subgrids which we can think of as a network of wetlands.  The ultimate
    intent, here, is to generalize the recursive division algorithm.
    This particular idea was inspired by the blog article [2].  (There
    are some differences, but I think they are "similar in spirit".)

    In essence, the idea is straighforward.  We start with two cells which
    we can think of as water sources.  Water flows from each into
    neighboring cells, to form watersheds.  The main rule is that the
    two watersheds are kept separate.

        DESCRIPTION

            Don't override this constructor.  Instead, override parse_args,
            initialize, or configure.

        REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

            grid - a connected grid

            seeds - the water sources

            args - additional positional arguments (for subclasses)

        KEYWORD ARGUMENTS

            QueueType (default Queue) - the queuing structure
                This should be derived from GeneralizedQueue in module
                mazes.gqueue.

            qargs - additional queung arguments (dictionary)
                This should include the priority function if the queue is
                a priority queue.

            kwargs - additional keyword arguments (for subclasses)

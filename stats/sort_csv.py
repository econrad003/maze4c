    ARGUMENTS

        filename - the filename for the CSV.
        header_rows - the number of rows in the header.  If there are no
            headers, enter 0.
        group_rows - the number of rows in each group other than the
            header.  For example, if each group conists of a row of mean
            values followed by a row of standard deviations, then the

            g[-2] = [header1, header2, ...]

    """extract columns for sorting

    ARGUMENTS

        g - the dictionary returned by group_csv

        rowcols - one or more row/column pairs where the row indicates the
            0-based row in a group and the 0-based column in that row

    RETURNS:

        A list of little lists
            the little lists contain the requested data and (last) the
            group number

    EXAMPLE

        Suppose our data has no headers and appears in a spreadsheet
        as follows:

                (A)     (B)     (C)
            1A   55      77     foo
            1B   66      88     bar
            2A   99     111     foobar
            2B  222     333     baz

        The row labels here indicate that the groups consist of 2 rows.
        So our "g" dictionary looks like this:

            g[-2]   []
            g[-1]   2
            g[0]    [[55, 77, foo], [66, 88, bar]]
            g[1]    [[99, 111, foobar], [222, 333, baz]]

        To select column 0 from row 1 and column 2 from row 0, our
        call is:

            result = extract_columns(g, 1, 0, 0, 2)

        The value of result is:

            [[66, foo, 0], [222, foobar, 0]]

        If, instead, we had mixed up the row/column order and entered:

            result = extract_columns(g, 0, 1, 2, 0)

        then an IndexError exception would be raised as g[0][2][0]
        does not exist.
